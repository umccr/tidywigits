{tidywigits} is an R package that parses and tidies outputs from the [WiGiTS]
suite of genome and transcriptome analysis tools for cancer research and diagnostics,
created by the Hartwig Medical Foundation.

In short, it traverses through a directory containing results from one or more
runs of WiGiTS tools, parses any files it recognises, tidies
them up (which includes data reshaping, normalisation, column name cleanup etc.),
and writes them to the output format of choice e.g. Apache Parquet, PostgreSQL,
TSV, RDS.
